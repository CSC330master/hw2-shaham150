Part 3 - My Answers:
1. The rules for collaboration on assignments are that collaboration is allowd within our own group, but that we may only generally discuss assignments, but not have any real collaboration, with classmates outside of our group.
2. External references are allowed for homework assignments, so long as criteria are met: students must be able to explain the concepts they used which were not covered in class, and a document listing consulted sources must be submitted with each assignment. Additionally, help from AI is permitted, so long as a statement is submitted detailing the extent of use of AI for help with the assignment.
3. The penalty for late assignments is a 10% deduction in the assignment grade per day late, with the only exceptions being given for extreme circumstances.
4. I read through the syllabus, but I did not find anything about what the penalty is for missing classes.
